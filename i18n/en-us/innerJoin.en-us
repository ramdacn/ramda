 * Takes a predicate `pred`, a list `xs`, and a list `ys`, and returns a list
 * `xs'` comprising each of the elements of `xs` which is equal to one or more
 * elements of `ys` according to `pred`.
 *
 * `pred` must be a binary function expecting an element from each list.
 *
 * `xs`, `ys`, and `xs'` are treated as sets, semantically, so ordering should
 * not be significant, but since `xs'` is ordered the implementation guarantees
 * that its values are in the same order as they appear in `xs`. Duplicates are
 * not removed, so `xs'` may contain duplicates if `xs` contains duplicates.
