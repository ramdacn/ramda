 * The `mapAccum` function behaves like a combination of map and reduce; it
 * applies a function to each element of a list, passing an accumulating
 * parameter from left to right, and returning a final value of this
 * accumulator together with the new list.
 *
 * The iterator function receives two arguments, *acc* and *value*, and should
 * return a tuple *[acc, value]*.
