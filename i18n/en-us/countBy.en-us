 * Counts the elements of a list according to how many match each value of a
 * key generated by the supplied function. Returns an object mapping the keys
 * produced by `fn` to the number of occurrences in the list. Note that all
 * keys are coerced to strings because of how JavaScript objects work.
 *
 * Acts as a transducer if a transformer is given in list position.
