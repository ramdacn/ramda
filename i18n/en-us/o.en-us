 * `o` is a curried composition function that returns a unary function.
 * Like [`compose`](#compose), `o` performs right-to-left function composition.
 * Unlike [`compose`](#compose), the rightmost function passed to `o` will be
 * invoked with only one argument. Also, unlike [`compose`](#compose), `o` is
 * limited to accepting only 2 unary functions. The name o was chosen because
 * of its similarity to the mathematical composition operator âˆ˜.
