 * Builds a list from a seed value. Accepts an iterator function, which returns
 * either false to stop iteration or an array of length 2 containing the value
 * to add to the resulting list and the seed to be used in the next call to the
 * iterator function.
 *
 * The iterator function receives one argument: *(seed)*.
