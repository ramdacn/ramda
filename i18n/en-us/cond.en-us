 * Returns a function, `fn`, which encapsulates `if/else, if/else, ...` logic.
 * `R.cond` takes a list of [predicate, transformer] pairs. All of the arguments
 * to `fn` are applied to each of the predicates in turn until one returns a
 * "truthy" value, at which point `fn` returns the result of applying its
 * arguments to the corresponding transformer. If none of the predicates
 * matches, `fn` returns undefined.
