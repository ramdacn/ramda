 * Returns a new list containing the first `n` elements of a given list,
 * passing each value to the supplied predicate function, and terminating when
 * the predicate function returns `false`. Excludes the element that caused the
 * predicate function to fail. The predicate function is passed one argument:
 * *(value)*.
 *
 * Dispatches to the `takeWhile` method of the second argument, if present.
 *
 * Acts as a transducer if a transformer is given in list position.
