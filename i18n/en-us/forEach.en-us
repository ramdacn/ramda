 * Iterate over an input `list`, calling a provided function `fn` for each
 * element in the list.
 *
 * `fn` receives one argument: *(value)*.
 *
 * Note: `R.forEach` does not skip deleted or unassigned indices (sparse
 * arrays), unlike the native `Array.prototype.forEach` method. For more
 * details on this behavior, see:
 * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach#Description
 *
 * Also note that, unlike `Array.prototype.forEach`, Ramda's `forEach` returns
 * the original array. In some libraries this function is named `each`.
 *
 * Dispatches to the `forEach` method of the second argument, if present.
