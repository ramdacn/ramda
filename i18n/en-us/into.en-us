 * Transforms the items of the list with the transducer and appends the
 * transformed items to the accumulator using an appropriate iterator function
 * based on the accumulator type.
 *
 * The accumulator can be an array, string, object or a transformer. Iterated
 * items will be appended to arrays and concatenated to strings. Objects will
 * be merged directly or 2-item arrays will be merged as key, value pairs.
 *
 * The accumulator can also be a transformer object that provides a 2-arity
 * reducing iterator function, step, 0-arity initial value function, init, and
 * 1-arity result extraction function result. The step function is used as the
 * iterator function in reduce. The result function is used to convert the
 * final accumulator into the return type and in most cases is R.identity. The
 * init function is used to provide the initial accumulator.
 *
 * The iteration is performed with R.reduce after initializing the transducer.
