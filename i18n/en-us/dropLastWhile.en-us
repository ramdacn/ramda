 * Returns a new list excluding all the tailing elements of a given list which
 * satisfy the supplied predicate function. It passes each value from the right
 * to the supplied predicate function, skipping elements until the predicate
 * function returns a `falsy` value. The predicate function is applied to one argument:
 * *(value)*.
 *
 * Acts as a transducer if a transformer is given in list position.
