 * A function wrapping calls to the two functions in an `||` operation,
 * returning the result of the first function if it is truth-y and the result
 * of the second function otherwise. Note that this is short-circuited,
 * meaning that the second function will not be invoked if the first returns a
 * truth-y value.
 *
 * In addition to functions, `R.either` also accepts any fantasy-land compatible
 * applicative functor.
