 * Takes a spec object and a test object; returns true if the test satisfies
 * the spec, false otherwise. An object satisfies the spec if, for each of the
 * spec's own properties, accessing that property of the object gives the same
 * value (in [`R.equals`](#equals) terms) as accessing that property of the
 * spec.
 *
 * `whereEq` is a specialization of [`where`](#where).
