 * Returns a single item by iterating through the list, successively calling
 * the iterator function and passing it an accumulator value and the current
 * value from the array, and then passing the result to the next call.
 *
 * The iterator function receives two values: *(acc, value)*. It may use
 * `R.reduced` to shortcut the iteration.
 *
 * The arguments' order of `reduceRight`'s iterator function is *(value, acc)*.
 *
 * Note: `R.reduce` does not skip deleted or unassigned indices (sparse
 * arrays), unlike the native `Array.prototype.reduce` method. For more details
 * on this behavior, see:
 * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce#Description
 *
 * Dispatches to the `reduce` method of the third argument, if present.
