 * Takes two functions as pre- and post- processors respectively for a third function,
 * i.e. `promap(f, g, h)(x) === g(h(f(x)))`.
 *
 * Dispatches to the `promap` method of the third argument, if present,
 * according to the [FantasyLand Profunctor spec](https://github.com/fantasyland/fantasy-land#profunctor).
 *
 * Acts as a transducer if a transformer is given in profunctor position.
