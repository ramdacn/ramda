 * Takes a function `fn`, which takes a single array argument, and returns a
 * function which:
 *
 *   - takes any number of positional arguments;
 *   - passes these arguments to `fn` as an array; and
 *   - returns the result.
 *
 * In other words, R.unapply derives a variadic function from a function which
 * takes an array. R.unapply is the inverse of R.apply.
