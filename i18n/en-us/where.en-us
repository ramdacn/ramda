 * Takes a spec object and a test object; returns true if the test satisfies
 * the spec. Each of the spec's own properties must be a predicate function.
 * Each predicate is applied to the value of the corresponding property of the
 * test object. `where` returns true if all the predicates return true, false
 * otherwise.
 *
 * `where` is well suited to declaratively expressing constraints for other
 * functions such as `filter` and `find`.
