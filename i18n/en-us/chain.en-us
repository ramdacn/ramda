 * `chain` maps a function over a list and concatenates the results. `chain`
 * is also known as `flatMap` in some libraries.
 *
 * Dispatches to the `chain` method of the second argument, if present,
 * according to the [FantasyLand Chain spec](https://github.com/fantasyland/fantasy-land#chain).
 *
 * If second argument is a function, `chain(f, g)(x)` is equivalent to `f(g(x), x)`.
 *
 * Acts as a transducer if a transformer is given in list position.
