 * Creates a new list iteration function from an existing one by adding two new
 * parameters to its callback function: the current index, and the entire list.
 *
 * This would turn, for instance, [`R.map`](#map) function into one that
 * more closely resembles `Array.prototype.map`. Note that this will only work
 * for functions in which the iteration callback function is the first
 * parameter, and where the list is the last parameter. (This latter might be
 * unimportant if the list parameter is not used.)
