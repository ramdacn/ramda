 * Takes a function and
 * a [functor](https://github.com/fantasyland/fantasy-land#functor),
 * applies the function to each of the functor's values, and returns
 * a functor of the same shape.
 *
 * Ramda provides suitable `map` implementations for `Array` and `Object`,
 * so this function may be applied to `[1, 2, 3]` or `{x: 1, y: 2, z: 3}`.
 *
 * Dispatches to the `map` method of the second argument, if present.
 *
 * Acts as a transducer if a transformer is given in list position.
 *
 * Also treats functions as functors and will compose them together.
