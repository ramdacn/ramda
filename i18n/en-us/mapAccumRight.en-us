 * The mapAccumRight function behaves like a combination of map and reduce; it
 * applies a function to each element of a list, passing an accumulating
 * parameter from right to left, and returning a final value of this
 * accumulator together with the new list.
 *
 * Similar to `mapAccum`, except moves through the input list from the right to
 * the left.
 *
 * The iterator function receives two arguments, *value* and *acc*, and should
 * return a tuple *[value, acc]*.
