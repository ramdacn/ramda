 * A customisable version of [`R.memoize`](#memoize). `memoizeWith` takes an
 * additional function that will be applied to a given argument set and used to
 * create the cache key under which the results of the function to be memoized
 * will be stored. Care must be taken when implementing key generation to avoid
 * clashes that may overwrite previous entries erroneously.
