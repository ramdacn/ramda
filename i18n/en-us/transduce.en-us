 * Initializes a transducer using supplied iterator function. Returns a single
 * item by iterating through the list, successively calling the transformed
 * iterator function and passing it an accumulator value and the current value
 * from the array, and then passing the result to the next call.
 *
 * The iterator function receives two values: *(acc, value)*. It will be
 * wrapped as a transformer to initialize the transducer. A transformer can be
 * passed directly in place of an iterator function. In both cases, iteration
 * may be stopped early with the `R.reduced` function.
 *
 * A transducer is a function that accepts a transformer and returns a
 * transformer and can be composed directly.
 *
 * A transformer is an an object that provides a 2-arity reducing iterator
 * function, step, 0-arity initial value function, init, and 1-arity result
 * extraction function, result. The step function is used as the iterator
 * function in reduce. The result function is used to convert the final
 * accumulator into the return type and in most cases is R.identity. The init
 * function can be used to provide an initial accumulator, but is ignored by
 * transduce.
 *
 * The iteration is performed with R.reduce after initializing the transducer.
