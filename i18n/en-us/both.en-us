 * A function which calls the two provided functions and returns the `&&`
 * of the results.
 * It returns the result of the first function if it is false-y and the result
 * of the second function otherwise. Note that this is short-circuited,
 * meaning that the second function will not be invoked if the first returns a
 * false-y value.
 *
 * In addition to functions, `R.both` also accepts any fantasy-land compatible
 * applicative functor.
