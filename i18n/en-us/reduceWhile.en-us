 * Like [`reduce`](#reduce), `reduceWhile` returns a single item by iterating
 * through the list, successively calling the iterator function. `reduceWhile`
 * also takes a predicate that is evaluated before each step. If the predicate
 * returns `false`, it "short-circuits" the iteration and returns the current
 * value of the accumulator.
