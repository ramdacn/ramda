 * Returns a curried equivalent of the provided function, with the specified
 * arity. The curried function has two unusual capabilities. First, its
 * arguments needn't be provided one at a time. If `g` is `R.curryN(3, f)`, the
 * following are equivalent:
 *
 *   - `g(1)(2)(3)`
 *   - `g(1)(2, 3)`
 *   - `g(1, 2)(3)`
 *   - `g(1, 2, 3)`
 *
 * Secondly, the special placeholder value `R.__` may be used to specify
 * "gaps", allowing partial application of any combination of arguments,
 * regardless of their positions. If `g` is as above and `_` is `R.__`, the
 * following are equivalent:
 *
 *   - `g(1, 2, 3)`
 *   - `g(_, 2, 3)(1)`
 *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1)(2)`
 *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1, 2)`
 *   - `g(_, 2)(1)(3)`
 *   - `g(_, 2)(1, 3)`
 *   - `g(_, 2)(_, 3)(1)`
 *
