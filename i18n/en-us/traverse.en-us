 * Maps an [Applicative](https://github.com/fantasyland/fantasy-land#applicative)-returning
 * function over a [Traversable](https://github.com/fantasyland/fantasy-land#traversable),
 * then uses [`sequence`](#sequence) to transform the resulting Traversable of Applicative
 * into an Applicative of Traversable.
 *
 * Dispatches to the `sequence` method of the third argument, if present.
