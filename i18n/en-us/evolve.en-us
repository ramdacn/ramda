 * Creates a new object by recursively evolving a shallow copy of `object`,
 * according to the `transformation` functions. All non-primitive properties
 * are copied by reference.
 *
 * A `transformation` function will not be invoked if its corresponding key
 * does not exist in the evolved object.
