 * Accepts a converging function and a list of branching functions and returns
 * a new function. The arity of the new function is the same as the arity of
 * the longest branching function. When invoked, this new function is applied
 * to some arguments, and each branching function is applied to those same
 * arguments. The results of each branching function are passed as arguments
 * to the converging function to produce the return value.
