 * Returns a new list excluding the leading elements of a given list which
 * satisfy the supplied predicate function. It passes each value to the supplied
 * predicate function, skipping elements while the predicate function returns
 * `true`. The predicate function is applied to one argument: *(value)*.
 *
 * Dispatches to the `dropWhile` method of the second argument, if present.
 *
 * Acts as a transducer if a transformer is given in list position.
