 * Takes a spec object and a test object; each of the spec's own properties must be a predicate function.
 * Each predicate is applied to the value of the corresponding property of the
 * test object. `whereAny` returns true if at least one of the predicates return true,
 * false otherwise.
 *
 * `whereAny` is well suited to declaratively expressing constraints for other
 * functions such as [`filter`](#filter) and [`find`](#find).
