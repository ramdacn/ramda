 * Creates a new function that, when invoked, caches the result of calling `fn`
 * for a given argument set and returns the result. Subsequent calls to the
 * memoized `fn` with the same argument set will not result in an additional
 * call to `fn`; instead, the cached result for that set of arguments will be
 * returned.
