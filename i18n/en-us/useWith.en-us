 * Accepts a function `fn` and a list of transformer functions and returns a
 * new curried function. When the new function is invoked, it calls the
 * function `fn` with parameters consisting of the result of calling each
 * supplied handler on successive arguments to the new function.
 *
 * If more arguments are passed to the returned function than transformer
 * functions, those arguments are passed directly to `fn` as additional
 * parameters. If you expect additional arguments that don't need to be
 * transformed, although you can ignore them, it's best to pass an identity
 * function so that the new function reports the correct arity.
