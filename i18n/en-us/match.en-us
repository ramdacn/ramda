 * Tests a regular expression against a String. Note that this function will
 * return an empty array when there are no matches. This differs from
 * [`String.prototype.match`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/match)
 * which returns `null` when there are no matches.
